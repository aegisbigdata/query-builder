# query-builder
Jupyter notebooks for the AEGIS Query Builder

# Set-up and run instructions
1. Import the notebook in a project.

2. Manually run the first cell either with `ctrl+enter` or with Jupyter's run button. A button labelled "Initialise QB" will appear.

3. Press that button and wait for the paragraphs to run. You will know when it has finished from the cell prompts (the asterisks will be replaced by numbers).

4. A UI will be created for the user to continue with loading and querying data.
